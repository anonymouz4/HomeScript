# HomeScript
[![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://www.paypal.me/menahishayan)
Python script for command line control of [HomeBridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) (HomeKit)

Used to toggle Homebridge accessories On or Off via python script, no Home app required. You can set up a cronjob to enable automation, scripting and mimic other HomeKit functionalities

**Note:** as of HomeScript 4.1 the minimum requirement is Python3+ and HomeBridge 1.x.x+

## Examples
`homeScript.py -s MainLight 0`  | Switch off  
`homeScript.py -s MainLight 1`  | Switch on  
`homeScript.py -s MainLight`   | Toggle  
`homeScript.py -s lifx --hue 140` | RGB Lights Support  
`homeScript.py -s lifx --saturation` | Toggle even works on integer values

## Easy Match
The script doesn't require full names of the accessories.  

**For example**, if your light is called "MainLight", you can run:  
`homeScript.py -s MainLight 0` or  
`homeScript.py -s main 0`  
The script will automatically search for matching substrings and set the accessory value

## Group Actions
You can set multiple accessories (of the same type) in a single command:  
`homeScript.py -s all lights 1`  
`homeScript.py -s all switches 0`  

## Automations
HomeScript allows you to create automations **without** a Home Hub!

## HS Apps
Introducing HomeScript Apps! Allows for modularity and extendability using custom third-party apps and scripts. WIP
